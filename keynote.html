  <p class="body">Dr. Lynda McCarthy is a Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biology at Ryerson University. Her research includes aquatic ecotoxicology, Great Lakes pollution and remediation, and the impact on organisms from land-applied pulp mill and municipal biosolids. In the past decade, she has received funding for her research from sources such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council ( NSERC) and the National Centres for Excellence’s (NCE) Canadian Water Network. She attended Queen’s University and the University of Waterloo where she gained a BSc and a PhD respectively and was a Department of Fisheries and Oceans federal government scientist for many years at the Great Lakes institute <i>Canada Centre for Inland Waters</i> (CCIW). At Ryerson University, Dr. McCarthy is the founding visionary behind Ryerson Urban Water (RUW) and is currently an Executive Member.
