  <p class="body">Viviane Yargeau is the Chair of the Department of Chemical Engineering at McGill University, an Associate Member of the McGill School of Environment and the Senior Scientific Advisor of Earth Alive Clean Technologies Inc. She obtained her PhD from Université de Sherbrooke and worked on various initiatives at that institution for two years before joining McGill in 2004. She established the Controlling Contaminants of Concern (3Cs) laboratory, which is now internationally recognized for research on the fate and effects of contaminants in the environment and in engineered systems. Prof. Yargeau holds a MELS Teaching Chair. She has contributed to creating awareness about the presence and impact of trace contaminants in water and to the development of improved wastewater treatment technologies, such as ozonation, for the protection of our water resources. She is often invited to collaborate in international projects where she actively participates in the development of new tools to monitor water quality and generates data from Canada that contributes to global data bases on water quality. She also serves as Editor for the Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, and she is a member of the Board of Directors for the private sector firm, Earth Alive Clean Technologies commercializing two products she co-invented. She has several collaborations at McGill, as well as across Canada, and in Mexico and Europe, both in academia and with industry. </p>
