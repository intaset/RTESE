  <p class="body">Professor Robert Delatolla is an Associate Professor at the University of Ottawa. He received his Ph.D. from the Department of Chemical Engineering at McGill University. Professor Delatollaâ€™s current research is focused on critical water, stormwater and wastewater issues. His expertise lies in biological treatment with a focus on developing an understanding of engineered systems at the meso, micro and molecular-scale to improve their design and operation. His research endeavours include collaborative ventures with industrial and municipal partners. Professor Delatolla is currently working on characterising biofilms in water and wastewater treatment systems; optimization of advanced and hybrid biofilm treatment systems; optimization of anammox design for mainstream treatment; nutrient removal at cold temperatures; biological treatment of industrial wastewater; understanding hydrogen sulfide production in wet stormwater ponds; and biofiltration performance as a means of disinfection by-product removal.</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> MBBR Technology for Nutrient Removal at Lagoon Facilities: Cold Climate Performance and Bacterial Community Analysis</p>
