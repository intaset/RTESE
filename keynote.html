  <p class="body">From wearable and mobile communications to power lines and appliances, electromagnetic (EM) energy plays a significant part in many of the innovations that we take for granted everyday. A basic force of nature, this nonionizing energy can be harnessed and used, but still holds the potential to be risky. The question remains, how safe are EM technologies? Especially a new generation of higher frequency telecommunication technologies are being added to the current 2G, 3G, 4G frequencies to offer an array of frequencies that will accumulate enough bandwidth to power future wireless multimedia and the Internet of Things. This speech will present a cutting-edge knowledge and research findings on environmental implications of EM energy comprising low frequency fields and radio frequency radiation including some of the available literature on 5G technologies which are far less investigated for human and environmental effects. </p>

  <p class="body">Riadh Habash is an engineering educator and Research Chair on Electromagnetic Energy and Health at the McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment, University of Ottawa. The author of several books and research papers; recipient of the National Wighton Fellowship and several university interdisciplinary initiatives awards; taught for more than 35 years at various universities worldwide. </p>
