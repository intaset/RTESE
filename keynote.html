  <p class="body">Dr. Lynda McCarthy is a Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biology at Ryerson University. Her research includes aquatic ecotoxicology, Great Lakes pollution and remediation, and the impact on organisms from land-applied pulp mill and municipal biosolids. In the past decade, she has received funding for her research from sources such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council ( NSERC) and the National Centres for Excellence’s (NCE) Canadian Water Network. She attended Queen’s University and the University of Waterloo where she gained a BSc and a PhD respectively and was a Department of Fisheries and Oceans federal government scientist for many years at the Great Lakes institute <i>Canada Centre for Inland Waters</i> (CCIW). At Ryerson University, Dr. McCarthy is the founding visionary behind Ryerson Urban Water (RUW) and is currently an Executive Member. She is also leading an initiative that brings Ontario school boards and the Ministry of Education together with education experts in an effort to develop a deep environmental literacy in our children. Her motto is: from the classroom to the boardroom to the legislature.</p>

  <p class="body">Ya-Huei (Cathy) Chin is an assistant professor of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry at the University of Toronto. She is a Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in Advanced Catalysis for Sustainable Chemistry and a recipient of Ontario’s Early Researcher Award (2014) and Imperial Oil’s University Research Award (2014). She obtained her Doctoral of Philosophy degree in Chemical Engineering from University of California, Berkeley (2011). She was a senior research scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), one of the ten United States National Research Laboratories, where she held a joint appointment at the William R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy’s national scientific user facility (2000-2005). Cathy’s research addresses the technological challenges in catalytic processing of hydrocarbons and oxygenates, emission control, microchemical reactor development, and on-anode natural gas reforming in solid oxide fuel cell. Her recent work focuses on elucidating the molecular events during catalytic conversions of alkanes, alkenes, and oxygenates to liquid fuels and value-added chemicals. Specifically, she applies isotopic, kinetic, and density functional theory methods to investigate the dynamics of catalyst surfaces and their kinetic consequences. </p>
