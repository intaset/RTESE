    <h3>Symposium</h3>
  	<p class="body">The International Conference of Recent Trends in Environmental Science and Engineering (RTESE'17) invites you to propose a symposium.</p>

   <p class="body">The proposed symposium, if accepted, will be co-located with and under the umbrella of the conference.</p>

   <p class="body">Proposals by prospective chairs should be submitted to <a href="mailto:info@rtese.com" class="body-link">info@rtese.com</a> and will be evaluated by the Organizing and Scientific Committees. Upon approval, the Organizing Committee will disseminate the news through the conference website and call for papers. To obtain a high attendance, we kindly ask that the prospective chairs also publicize the event and personally contact researchers who they think will be interested to contribute. The minimum number of registered presenters for the event to take place is 7. Should attendance reach this minimum requirement, registration fees for the Chair will be waived.</p>

      <p class="body"><b>Topic of Workshop:<i><br>Combined Photochemical and Biological Processes for Water and Wastewater Treatment: An Overview of Trends, Advances, and Future</i></b> </p>

      <p class="body">One of the greatest challenges of water and wastewater treatment technologies is the use of combined processes to achieve the most advantages of each process alone. The choice of the process and/or integration of the processes depend strongly on the wastewater characteristics, concentrations, and the desired efficiencies. It has been observed that the coupling of a biological reactor with advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) could reduce the final concentrations of the effluent to the desired values. Advanced oxidation technologies are mainly based on the production of highly potent hydroxyl radicals which attack organic compounds and produce carbon dioxide and water. However, optimizing the total cost of the treatment is a challenge, as AOTs are much more expensive than the biological processes alone. Therefore, an appropriate design should not only consider the ability of this coupling to reduce the concentrations of organic pollutants, but also try to obtain the desired results in a cost effective process. To consider the total cost of the treatment, the residence time in biological and photochemical reactors, the kinetic rates, and the capital and operating costs of the reactors play significant roles. In most case studies, it has been shown that the integration processes were more efficient than individual processes. However, slight changes in the configuration of the reactors, temperature, pH, treatment time, concentration of oxidants, and microorganism colonies could lead to a great deviation in results. Hence, in some cases, the coupling of these processes lowered the total efficiency of the system. It is important to consider the possibility of coupling different processes in lowering the total cost of the system while maximizing the rate of total degradation of organic pollutants. In this workshop, recent developments and trends on the integration of photochemical and biological processes for the degradation of organic pollutants in water and wastewater will be discussed. Case studies for the treatment of selected organic compounds will be addressed.</p>
